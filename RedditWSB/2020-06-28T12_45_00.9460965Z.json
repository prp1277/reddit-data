Unfortunately, something happened to my YouTube account. Let me lay out the details, and perhaps someone here works at Google or YouTube, or knows someone who does, who can help. This is a bit verbose, but my experience in matters like this is that it pays to be too detailed. \n\n I use a certain gmail as my 'main email'. I also have a dozen email addresses associated with various companies I've been involved in. For some reason I started making YouTube videos with one of those email addresses, not my main email. Before I could realize it, I figured, well, that'll just be my YouTube account and I'll never lose access to that email, right!?\n\n One joke about Hillary Clinton's reptilian DNA requiring careful procurement and examination to determine the Alex Jones-style truth of the matter, and I found myself in what could only be described as 'sleepaway camp for thugs'. The corporate email I used ended up dying due to nonpayment. Banks like to cancel their relationships with me abruptly, and the folks I put in charge of maintaining this kind of thing didn't do so great of a job. So that email attached to the YouTube with thousands of videos, millions of views, died. Then the channel died. I am 99% sure the channel is not in trouble for any violation of policy. I just think when the email is unresponsive (and YouTube is constantly sending you all kinds of spam garbage), YouTube closes your account. \n\n I have access to the email in question once again. Attempting to login to YouTube with said email is not permitted since its not a gmail. This begs the question of how I used to do it before. Well, I had GSuite. So, my team signed up for GSuite again. Signing into YouTube takes a 30 day \"seasoning period\" (I have no other way to put that... probationary period?) before you can access YouTube. That should be up in a few weeks. I'm not holding my breath that all the videos will be there when we log back in.\n\n As many of you know, YouTube does not have a customer support function. Everything is done to make it as hard as possible for the customer to get help. So Question 1: is there an alternative channel for YouTube customer support that we're unaware of? Question 2: Does anyone have a 'plug'--either an employee at YT/GOOG or someone who knows a human being there that is willing to take 15 minutes to figure out what happened and help. \n\n For me, YouTube videos were a way to show anyone who was interested a window into the 'real' me. The mainstream media concoction, which I enjoyed creating, was a fun ruse but also a self-propagating and hard to control monster. Thankfully, the authentic Shkreli was live on YouTube for all to see. Most people who saw videos of me came away with a favorable impression. Without those videos, the NBC narrative prevails. Thanks for your thoughts and attention on this matter. As a gift, I leave you with the thought that I would avoid being long any coronavirus-related securities as they universally appear to be overvalued to this observer.

I have noticed since past 3 quarters that just towards the end, Elon suddenly starts being jolly and memey. This sometimes gets so profound that 2 quarters ago, just an hour before the earnings, he tweeted the meme \"\\*chair\\* are underappreciated\".\n\nI think Elon's recent tweets are a good sign. Elon knows Tesla is making a profit. S&amp;P 500 is secured.",

I have noticed since past 3 quarters that just towards the end, Elon suddenly starts being jolly and memey. This sometimes gets so profound that 2 quarters ago, just an hour before the earnings, he tweeted the meme &amp;quot;*chair* are underappreciated&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think Elon&amp;#39;s recent tweets are a good sign. Elon knows Tesla is making a profit. S&amp;amp;P 500 is secured.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

          "selftext": "I see a ton of you guys posting about waiting for the tech bubble to pop and I want to help you guys stop losing money by clearing up some common misconceptions I see in the daily threads. Here goes:\n\n**1) Tech is not a single industry, it is the combination of multiple different industries in various stages of their life-cycles**, all of which's business model are impacted differently by Covid 19. Yes, there are consumer products, social media, online retail and advertising, but there is also security, infrastructure, enterprise management software, database management, content delivery networks, gaming, financial services, communications, etc. All of these have different revenue models, customer types and growth trajectories independent of each other. By labeling them all tech and not understanding why they may or may not be thriving, you're going to miss out on big runs or talk yourself into costly contrarian puts during runs.\n\nWith the understanding that tech is not a monolith, but many industries, think about how covid actually impacts these individual industries. In many cases, covid has accelerated digital transformation and sped up adoption of these companies. Web services are more important than before (MSFT, AMZN), security is critical (CRWD, OKTA, ZS), more people are viewing content from the internet (NET, FSLY, AKAM) and main street retail is closed (SHOP, AMZN, ETSY), etc. etc. ***Most of these companies are non-discretionary or infrastructure spend*** \\- nobody is cancelling an important enterprise management system (VEEV, EVBG, CRM, NOW) because of covid - they'll fire headcount first. \n\n**2) If your analysis is that the company is not profitable and so its overvalued, you're doing it wrong.** *Know the difference between Gross Margins and Operating Profit.* If the company's core business is very profitable and they're spending a fuckload on product development, hiring sales and building corporate infrastructure, it doesn't matter if their operating profit is negative if their sales are growing 35%. The revenues will catch up. Quickly.\n\n**3) The Subscription Based Revenue Model (SaaS) is the greatest things to happen to these companies and investors in 20 years.** Having smooth, recurring, reliable revenue streams, impacted only by churn and growth allows helps eliminate big negative surprises during earnings and compounds growth quickly for the businesses. \n\nTake MSFT for example - for us boomers (I'm 40), they used to release a new Windows updates every 2-3 years and inevitably you'd have to purchase it, adapt to it, and sometimes you'd skip an update. Their earnings were based on how popular the updates were and how much people bought them. In 2015, they switched from that model to SaaS (software as a service). Now, I pay an annual subscription to MSFT for their applications. I never think about it - its just subtracted from my account - and will pay it as long as I have a computer. They dont have to worry about coming up with big new updates.\n\nCompare this to some other industries. Life Sciences - you invest millions in research and the drug has to show efficacy and get approved by FDA, which is major boom or bust. Automotive - design a great car and hope you find a market for it, but then your sales are massively impacted macro trends. Nobody is fucking cancelling MSFT subscriptions during a recession.\n\n**4) Tech's operating model makes its potential for exponential growth unmatched.** For a company like Fastly or Okta, think about what you would actually have to do to provide the infrastructure for 40% annual growth - you spend on product development, hiring customer success/support and sales people. You beef up HR, operating systems and infrastructure. *But your biggest expense by far is hiring people, who can work from home and be quickly removed.* \n\nCompare that to some other industries. For a car company to grow 40%, beyond the people cost, they need massive capex investments to improve their production infrastructure and they'll have to be sure their supply chain of small manufacturers can keep up, not to mention the impact of fluctuations in raw material costs (read, tarriffs), marketing and inventory storage. Thats a lot of moving parts. These implications apply to most manufacturing industries. For a life sciences company to grow 40%, they have to discover a massive blockbuster medicine, because users of current non-generic medications don't spike 40% a year. Put simply, it is much easier/cheaper/faster to just hire people and acquire technology than having to have physical infrastructure, supply chains, warehousing etc. This makes techs growth potential vastly superior than other industries.\n\n**5) Finally, and most importantly, this is not 2001. I will repeat this for the real boomers here who were burned before, this is not 2001.** In 2001 the companies did not have real growth, revenue, consumer adoption. Today they do. Take a look at Redpoints look at 2020 Q1 earnings for public SaaS companies ( [https://medium.com/redpoint-ventures/a-look-back-at-q1-public-saas-earnings-e392a7f6f4f8](https://medium.com/redpoint-ventures/a-look-back-at-q1-public-saas-earnings-e392a7f6f4f8) ). The median company of the 54 public companies followed had 31% YoY growth, 74% gross margin and 117% customer retention. Thats insane.\n\nTLDR; tech is not overvalued - these cloud companies are growing exponentially and in many cases, their business models and adoption/use of their services are enhanced by Covid. \n\nPOSITIONS - FSLY 50C, 60C 9/18, SPOT 230C 7/17, DDOG 90C 8/21, NET 36C 8/21, SE 106C 7/17, ENPH 50C 8/2, TWLO 210C 8/21\n\nMy qualifications - I spent many years as strategic consultant with a fancy mba that focused on business growth and have worked in literally every industry",

Mexico and the US have a tightly coupled trading relationship. The USMCA stands to invigorate that relationship and emphasize successes in energy production, manufacturing price parity, and tech-invoked trade access. The exercising of law will result in institutional confidence, resulting in reasonable profits from July-September.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Mexico is Buy American as a nation. It has a tightly coupled relationship with American output.](https://preview.redd.it/jcz0alawji751.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a85687aafa11d3bf4e600e380f08fdea89eea52)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- NAFTA ends June 30th and the USMCA goes into effect July 1st. The US is the last nation ready to prepare the changes.\n\n\\- Trump will soon be under pressure for some form of economic stimulus. This may be in the form of an infrastructure bill by the time September or the election rolls around.\n\n\\- The USMCA modernizes up cross border digital trade and seeks to modernize some structural changes that have transformed in the energy industries invoking industrial surplus. This will increase the rate of exchange\n\n\\- These changes from Facebook (WhatsApp), Walmart, Amazon, Costco, Shopify, Cloudflare, Paypal, and other important supply chain players like **SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS** to supercharge trade between the two nations.\n\n\\- These changes also encourage energy production between US &amp; Mexico, where Mexico has fallen behind and Texas has exceeded.\n\n\\- **NO** this DD is not about the obvious auto-manufacturing benefit. It is an important factor but there is plenty of evidence that only focuses on that element of the USMCA.\n\n\\- Kansas City Southern is one of the ten Class-I Railroads of the US. It is the **ONLY** Class-I Railroad that connects the US &amp; Mexico and runs along the Gulf of Mexico.  This results in streamlined cross-border energy and product trades. This also means that **KSU** **stands to agnostically benefit from economic improvements in energy output and nation building from both the US &amp; Mexico.**\n\n\\- Mexico is an important bulwark nation for the US to bolster as a partner against Chinese economic threat. Its relationship with US is far different than international partners like Germany, India, and Japan. There is a far greater efficiency potential between the two nations across many industries related to logistics, mining, energy, manufacturing, telecom, and agriculture.\n\n\\- Mexico's higher education and English learners have rapidly increased as Mexico radically approaches middle incomes and its narcotics problem. By most accounts, the US is least behind in terms of social policy regarding The Drug War. The US stands to adapt and benefit most rapidly from the economic bottleneck the Drug War has produced.\n\n\\- Migration is complex between the two nations. It is arguably a symbiotic relationship regarding wages, education, crime, and currency parity with respects to US &amp; Mexico.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[1994, the signing of NAFTA was a consequential inflection point in economic history.](https://preview.redd.it/73u5e39bki751.png?width=3045&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a8296fa4d5fb1797d141f936c4809c683b022e4)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Mexico serves as important trading vector and access point to increase global price efficiencies in auto markets, energy, materials, agriculture, and labor.](https://preview.redd.it/c4ej9hcrki751.png?width=638&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0062950618749d315101fb97d09237db961e2d40)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# # The Product\n\nKansas City Southern is a relatively small railroad compared to other systems like Union Pacific. You can argue that this is beneficial as is allows the railroad to execute and iterate more rapidly to changes and optimize for efficiencies that larger railroads cannot.\n\nKSU does this with **Precision Railroad Scheduling** along with other Class-I railroads but to great effect. In simple terms, this means that railroads prioritize the scheduling of arrival and departures over the weight and output of each train run. This has resulted in\n\n* Greater speed\n* Greater flexibility to economic changes (Amazon, energy, etc)\n* Greater competition to trucking\n* Increased fuel efficiency\n* Greater economic output\n* Reduced costs for rail trade\n\n*This is an excellent primary for economic growth.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[List of traded goods managed by KSU](https://preview.redd.it/jwed8v3hoi751.png?width=1169&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0a1cb82b7dcfa7ab59a727bc50991c9d303e3ef7)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Diversified to benefit &amp; reflect Mexican-American progress](https://preview.redd.it/6qvks6g0oi751.png?width=2386&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=422e6aa0728e13e9fab0a76893522317a015a9cb)\n\n# \n\n[Institutional restructuring](https://preview.redd.it/bd6h7tpzoi751.png?width=543&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3958e442f2cce7001739fbc333689ba5c7a56379)\n\n# \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Market ineffeciencies will rebalance with USMCA changes.](https://preview.redd.it/kjlml0x5pi751.png?width=540&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a4a562b56d075fd1b6c6229f823aa8e5718c3f3)\n\n# \n\n# # The Macroeconomic view of Texas &amp; Nuevo Leon's economic zones\n\nThe reality is that there are logistical positions in Texas and Monterrey trade vectors that is strategically advantageous. Monterrey is a trading city located near the southern border that operates as an important global industrial zone for products and services delivered from Samsung, MSCI Financial, Toyota, Siemens, and the like because the region's geography permits it.\n\nThe story is quite simple. Mexico needs more energy output. Texas has it. Mexican can grow it. The USMCA is designed to directly benefit the economies of Mexico &amp; Texas.\n\nMonterrey, of course, is not the only important vector in Mexico that KSU falls under.

I&amp;#39;m here to bring &lt;strong&gt;TAQUITOS&lt;/strong&gt; during these trying times. I have come with fresh research off the tortilla press for my amigos at Wall Street Bets&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sitting here getting used to my &lt;strong&gt;NEW  Gigabyte 17 with NVIDIA RTX&lt;/strong&gt; that I bought with the &lt;strong&gt;TORO PLAY&lt;/strong&gt; from my last DD on CDN infrastructure &amp;amp; serverless computing. It was quite successful, as Fastly rallied beyond the success of market favorites like Zoom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I need to get used to the keyboard and writing on non-Macs again so I figured to write about my next play. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kansas City Southern is a very uniquely positioned business that plays an important role in all of our lives. It is the rail the connects the US and Mexico and it will grow with the release of USMCA on July 1st and Trump&amp;#39;s infrastructure bill.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My style of investing is principled by exercising common sense and investing in deep market relationships - I am not generally interested in investing in only a product, but how the product fits and its impact on an economic model&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;# USMCA FACTS&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;The USMCA is a 1 Trillion+ restructuring&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/446zfa81ji751.png?width=1845&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=e0f9608f5f21eff915b87babb4edc25e4c0703df\"&gt;Mexico is critically underbanked and underserved by technology and trade potential.

Mexico and the US have a tightly coupled trading relationship. The USMCA stands to invigorate that relationship and emphasize successes in energy production, manufacturing price parity, and tech-invoked trade access. The exercising of law will result in institutional confidence, resulting in reasonable profits from July-September.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/jcz0alawji751.png?width=1600&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=7a85687aafa11d3bf4e600e380f08fdea89eea52\"&gt;Mexico is Buy American as a nation. It has a tightly coupled relationship with American output.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- NAFTA ends June 30th and the USMCA goes into effect July 1st. The US is the last nation ready to prepare the changes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Trump will soon be under pressure for some form of economic stimulus. This may be in the form of an infrastructure bill by the time September or the election rolls around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- The USMCA modernizes up cross border digital trade and seeks to modernize some structural changes that have transformed in the energy industries invoking industrial surplus. This will increase the rate of exchange&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- These changes from Facebook (WhatsApp), Walmart, Amazon, Costco, Shopify, Cloudflare, Paypal, and other important supply chain players like &lt;strong&gt;SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS&lt;/strong&gt; to supercharge trade between the two nations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- These changes also encourage energy production between US &amp;amp; Mexico, where Mexico has fallen behind and Texas has exceeded.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- &lt;strong&gt;NO&lt;/strong&gt; this DD is not about the obvious auto-manufacturing benefit. It is an important factor but there is plenty of evidence that only focuses on that element of the USMCA.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Kansas City Southern is one of the ten Class-I Railroads of the US. It is the &lt;strong&gt;ONLY&lt;/strong&gt; Class-I Railroad that connects the US &amp;amp; Mexico and runs along the Gulf of Mexico.  This results in streamlined cross-border energy and product trades. This also means that &lt;strong&gt;KSU&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;stands to agnostically benefit from economic improvements in energy output and nation building from both the US &amp;amp; Mexico.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Mexico is an important bulwark nation for the US to bolster as a partner against Chinese economic threat. Its relationship with US is far different than international partners like Germany, India, and Japan. There is a far greater efficiency potential between the two nations across many industries related to logistics, mining, energy, manufacturing, telecom, and agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Mexico&amp;#39;s higher education and English learners have rapidly increased as Mexico radically approaches middle incomes and its narcotics problem. By most accounts, the US is least behind in terms of social policy regarding The Drug War. The US stands to adapt and benefit most rapidly from the economic bottleneck the Drug War has produced.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Migration is complex between the two nations. It is arguably a symbiotic relationship regarding wages, education, crime, and currency parity with respects to US &amp;amp; Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/73u5e39bki751.png?width=3045&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=2a8296fa4d5fb1797d141f936c4809c683b022e4\"&gt;1994, the signing of NAFTA was a consequential inflection point in economic history.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/c4ej9hcrki751.png?width=638&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=0062950618749d315101fb97d09237db961e2d40\"&gt;Mexico serves as important trading vector and access point to increase global price efficiencies in auto markets, energy, materials, agriculture, and labor.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;# The Product&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kansas City Southern is a relatively small railroad compared to other systems like Union Pacific. You can argue that this is beneficial as is allows the railroad to execute and iterate more rapidly to changes and optimize for efficiencies that larger railroads cannot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;KSU does this with &lt;strong&gt;Precision Railroad Scheduling&lt;/strong&gt; along with other Class-I railroads but to great effect. In simple terms, this means that railroads prioritize the scheduling of arrival and departures over the weight and output of each train run. This has resulted in&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Greater speed&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Greater flexibility to economic changes (Amazon, energy, etc)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Greater competition to trucking&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Increased fuel efficiency&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Greater economic output&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Reduced costs for rail trade&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is an excellent primary for economic growth.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/jwed8v3hoi751.png?width=1169&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=0a1cb82b7dcfa7ab59a727bc50991c9d303e3ef7\"&gt;List of traded goods managed by KSU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/6qvks6g0oi751.png?width=2386&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=422e6aa0728e13e9fab0a76893522317a015a9cb\"&gt;Diversified to benefit &amp;amp; reflect Mexican-American progress&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/bd6h7tpzoi751.png?width=543&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=3958e442f2cce7001739fbc333689ba5c7a56379\"&gt;Institutional restructuring&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/kjlml0x5pi751.png?width=540&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=2a4a562b56d075fd1b6c6229f823aa8e5718c3f3\"&gt;Market ineffeciencies will rebalance with USMCA changes.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;# The Macroeconomic view of Texas &amp;amp; Nuevo Leon&amp;#39;s economic zones&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reality is that there are logistical positions in Texas and Monterrey trade vectors that is strategically advantageous. Monterrey is a trading city located near the southern border that operates as an important global industrial zone for products and services delivered from Samsung, MSCI Financial, Toyota, Siemens, and the like because the region&amp;#39;s geography permits it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The story is quite simple. Mexico needs more energy output. Texas has it. Mexican can grow it. The USMCA is designed to directly benefit the economies of Mexico &amp;amp; Texas.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Monterrey, of course, is not the only important vector in Mexico that KSU falls under. Guadalajara, Jalisco houses Tesla operations and runs global avocado trade alongside the State of Michaocan. There are plenty of other examples.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/vh7j05cjpi751.png?width=2110&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=481c9586327f6814f5d86ce923dcc5e5fc139612\"&gt;Two cooperative, regional populists at the helm.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/tvx4tpzspi751.png?width=2099&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=04572fca1361c4e73db8a38ad1f70672973daa7c\"&gt;Mexico is primed for American economic bolstering and standardization.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/jqk2m167qi751.png?width=1207&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=9c336ca6fc6ac69001cb648128055a3f85eb95a9\"&gt;KSU overlaps directly with state growth points&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/xy5q9ifrqi751.png?width=1553&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=0417e4b0890d69eade5084407aff8aab6ca4d34d\"&gt;Mexico&amp;#39;s untapped energy potential behaves almost like an extension of Texas and south basin opportunities.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/97regzxvqi751.png?width=1478&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=49a0575d213a99365721ad3c6513745330d174ec\"&gt;KSU ultimately double-dips from the changes.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/qrb4z2ibri751.png?width=1111&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=b36d0cdec94557e9860a8d1b5666ca6864f5c19e\"&gt;Texas GDP 1.8T.
