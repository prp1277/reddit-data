Learn \"The Greeks\"**\n\nRemember, this isn't the simple world of stocks. You're trading complex financial derivatives. Welcome to the big leagues. It's actually quite simple to understand why most of you are losing:\n\n*complex derivatives* \\+ *autists* = *catastrophic results*\n\nBefore you trade options, you need to have a good understanding of Greeks - **Delta**, **Gamma**, **Theta** and **Vega** – and how each will affect the value of your option over time. Here is a simple infographic that /u/CooldudeXD provided so that people like us can understand:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Greeks](https://preview.redd.it/vj1nhu9mocr41.png?width=1619&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f289fa451048dc0d878170f3ea132bbe33d73305)\n\n\\------\n\n**2. Less YOLO, More DCA (Dollar cost average)**\n\nMany of you seem to be throwing your entire net worth into positions at once because you're so confident that the trade will move in your favor. I know this because I constantly see \"$0 buying power\" in your RH portfolio screenshots.\n\nI understand that YOLO'ing can be fun and exciting in the moment, but you are setting yourself up for imminent failure. I cringe when I see what some of you are doing. It's almost like you guys are purposely trying to lose so that you can come on here to post your loss porn. Some of you are truly sick in the head. In fact, once COVID settles, I think some of you should seriously consider getting yourself checked out.\n\nRemember that with the way options are designed, there are many forces working against you (theta decay, implied volatility crush, etc). This means that the stock can move in your direction, but your option will still lose value. It's more likely than not that after your first purchase, your option will lose some value in the subsequent days/weeks. That's why it's imperative that you always have sufficient capital in your account to keep adding to your position at lower prices. This will lower your average cost and make it more likely that you'll come out profitable. Be smart about how you add to your positions though. If new data comes along that invalidates your initial thesis, at that point it doesn't make much sense to keep adding to your position.\n\nThis is probably the #1 reason many of you fail. You need to build the temperament to be able to scale into your positions appropriately over time rather than use up all of your dry powder on day 1.\n\n\\------\n\n**3. Patience**\n\nI get sad whenever I see some of you buying options that expire in a week. Your thesis may be correct, but you need to give your positions time to fully play out. No one can predict what's going to happen in the next few days or week. This means you should probably buy options with later expiration dates so that you aren't forced out of your position too early. It may take a little extra research, but there's plenty of gains to be made in options with later expiration dates.\n\nYou also need the patience to stick to your beliefs (💎🙌). Too many of you are flip-flopping positions because you can't handle a bit of temporary pain or because someone on wsb told you to sell your spy puts and buy calls instead (don't let FOMO dictate your decisions!). Toughen up and learn to make your own logical decisions. If your option loses 50% of its value, as long you still like your position this should excite you because you can now buy more at a much cheaper price. If it loses another 50% after that, this should excite you further because you can now buy even more and you know that your eventual gains will be massive. Learn to play the long game and stop focusing so much on the short term. Your patience will pay off.\n\n\\-------\n\nI know that I sound like your wife right now and this isn't the post you wanted to read. In fact, much of my advice goes against what wsb stands for. But this is the post you need if you want to become a profitable autist.",

Learn &amp;quot;The Greeks&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remember, this isn&amp;#39;t the simple world of stocks. You&amp;#39;re trading complex financial derivatives. Welcome to the big leagues. It&amp;#39;s actually quite simple to understand why most of you are losing:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;complex derivatives&lt;/em&gt; + &lt;em&gt;autists&lt;/em&gt; = &lt;em&gt;catastrophic results&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before you trade options, you need to have a good understanding of Greeks - &lt;strong&gt;Delta&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Gamma&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Theta&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Vega&lt;/strong&gt; – and how each will affect the value of your option over time. Here is a simple infographic that &lt;a href=\"/u/CooldudeXD\"&gt;/u/CooldudeXD&lt;/a&gt; provided so that people like us can understand:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/vj1nhu9mocr41.png?width=1619&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=f289fa451048dc0d878170f3ea132bbe33d73305\"&gt;Greeks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;------&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Less YOLO, More DCA (Dollar cost average)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Many of you seem to be throwing your entire net worth into positions at once because you&amp;#39;re so confident that the trade will move in your favor. I know this because I constantly see &amp;quot;$0 buying power&amp;quot; in your RH portfolio screenshots.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I understand that YOLO&amp;#39;ing can be fun and exciting in the moment, but you are setting yourself up for imminent failure. I cringe when I see what some of you are doing. It&amp;#39;s almost like you guys are purposely trying to lose so that you can come on here to post your loss porn. Some of you are truly sick in the head. In fact, once COVID settles, I think some of you should seriously consider getting yourself checked out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remember that with the way options are designed, there are many forces working against you (theta decay, implied volatility crush, etc). This means that the stock can move in your direction, but your option will still lose value. It&amp;#39;s more likely than not that after your first purchase, your option will lose some value in the subsequent days/weeks. That&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s imperative that you always have sufficient capital in your account to keep adding to your position at lower prices. This will lower your average cost and make it more likely that you&amp;#39;ll come out profitable. Be smart about how you add to your positions though. If new data comes along that invalidates your initial thesis, at that point it doesn&amp;#39;t make much sense to keep adding to your position.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is probably the #1 reason many of you fail. You need to build the temperament to be able to scale into your positions appropriately over time rather than use up all of your dry powder on day 1.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;------&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Patience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I get sad whenever I see some of you buying options that expire in a week. Your thesis may be correct, but you need to give your positions time to fully play out. No one can predict what&amp;#39;s going to happen in the next few days or week. This means you should probably buy options with later expiration dates so that you aren&amp;#39;t forced out of your position too early. It may take a little extra research, but there&amp;#39;s plenty of gains to be made in options with later expiration dates.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You also need the patience to stick to your beliefs (💎🙌). Too many of you are flip-flopping positions because you can&amp;#39;t handle a bit of temporary pain or because someone on wsb told you to sell your spy puts and buy calls instead (don&amp;#39;t let FOMO dictate your decisions!). Toughen up and learn to make your own logical decisions. If your option loses 50% of its value, as long you still like your position this should excite you because you can now buy more at a much cheaper price. If it loses another 50% after that, this should excite you further because you can now buy even more and you know that your eventual gains will be massive. Learn to play the long game and stop focusing so much on the short term. Your patience will pay off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-------&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know that I sound like your wife right now and this isn&amp;#39;t the post you wanted to read. In fact, much of my advice goes against what wsb stands for. But this is the post you need if you want to become a profitable autist.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I'm hoping this will grab Chase's attention.  \nEDIT 2: Filed a FINRA compaint like a lot of you suggested\nEDIT 3: open to lawyer connections here. I have a full time job at a small startup so am exhausted to even do all this legal research. I’d offer 10% of what I’m owed.\n\nTO CHASE: I called while this was happening (left on hold by CS rep until market close), left a phone complaint with a researcher after it happened, then left a secure message on your webportal the day after. This is my last resort.\n\n\nI got into options because of the volatile market, did my due diligence. I signed up with Chase JPM as my brokerage: big mistake.\n\nLong story short, I bought some SNAP calls and NOK Puts during late March.  Later, both options shot straight up in value, SNAP call at \\~5000%, and the NOK put at \\~$8000 %, totaling in around $25,000 in profits. Price per contract when I bought: SNAP 0.16 NOK 0.06. Day contract price shooting up was March 18th.\n\nPicture Evidence: [Imgur Snapshot of My Youinvest](https://imgur.com/gallery/YztbkaK)\n\nPicture of purchase receipt: https://imgur.com/gallery/lrNh9Hy\n\nI tried to submit the order to Close, but Chase YouInvest gives me a message saying\n\n\"Due to the Large Amount Orders Rule, your order will be reviewed.\"\n\nGuess what? They kept it under review status all day long, and eventually the contracts expired worthless.\n\nSo I called customer support to ask them about this review process, and they said\"Any Options orders that total in $5000 in transactions must be reviewed by our team\".\n\nThey refused to lift the review policy from my account, and 2 weeks since the incident still have not heard back about the $25000 loss.\n\nDo not use YouInvest. I’m relatively new to stocks and options but this seems pretty close to fraud to me.",

I’d offer 10% of what I’m owed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TO CHASE: I called while this was happening (left on hold by CS rep until market close), left a phone complaint with a researcher after it happened, then left a secure message on your webportal the day after. This is my last resort.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got into options because of the volatile market, did my due diligence. I signed up with Chase JPM as my brokerage: big mistake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Long story short, I bought some SNAP calls and NOK Puts during late March.  Later, both options shot straight up in value, SNAP call at ~5000%, and the NOK put at ~$8000 %, totaling in around $25,000 in profits. Price per contract when I bought: SNAP 0.16 NOK 0.06. Day contract price shooting up was March 18th.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Picture Evidence: &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/gallery/YztbkaK\"&gt;Imgur Snapshot of My Youinvest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Picture of purchase receipt: &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/gallery/lrNh9Hy\"&gt;https://imgur.com/gallery/lrNh9Hy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried to submit the order to Close, but Chase YouInvest gives me a message saying&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Due to the Large Amount Orders Rule, your order will be reviewed.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Guess what? They kept it under review status all day long, and eventually the contracts expired worthless.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I called customer support to ask them about this review process, and they said&amp;quot;Any Options orders that total in $5000 in transactions must be reviewed by our team&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They refused to lift the review policy from my account, and 2 weeks since the incident still have not heard back about the $25000 loss.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do not use YouInvest. I’m relatively new to stocks and options but this seems pretty close to fraud to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

The 200 week moving average has been support for this entire bull market - 9 fucking years!!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qe68eao0jbr41.png?width=1044&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2640b176655d0341604e956532613eed2af27490\n\nSecond, it's the .382 Fib of the entire price decline from the all time high. The two line up perfectly. When a structural support (resistance) and a major fib line up, it's like wearing two condoms during gay sex - little jimmy has to work way harder to impregnate your boyfriend's sister's husband.\n\n![img](7od46vbjibr41 \"Second, it's the .382 Fib of this entire decline.\n\")\n\nNow look at the price action:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6be97modjbr41.png?width=1346&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=51ddf004701b380f9f67e8ec6f3797dea975dd4a\n\nIn a bull market, this would be hella bullish price action - price banging on the door, eventually breaking it down. But we're not in a bull market are we? Hellllll no we're not.\n\nIn a bull market, an impulse gap like the one we had this morning above a previous short term trend of the previous move (see the red line drawn from the ATH) would be on high volume.\n\nCheck out this pitiful volume today:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bwkoouzxjbr41.png?width=1346&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e55cad6e16a52e32f68c14a581211ce8222f05d0\n\nJust sad, sad volume for a gap impulse.\n\nFinally, factor in where we closed. RIGHT at the 200 weekly MA. Not above it. the final minute saw HUGE sell volumes into the close.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v71xmxsbkbr41.png?width=1346&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5a134ebbc82de1050f2cd145df0e8dacb25a577\n\nNow look, I'm not saying price can't continue up further. It absolutely could. There have been enormous short positioned established in the past two weeks which will put upward pressure on prices and could carry price to $270-280 if we break above $264 with high volume.\n\nBUT, if we fail here for the THIRD time. The selling is going to be absolutely vicious. 20 day realized volatility is 100. ONE FUCKING HUNDRED. UNFUCKING PRECEDENTED. The VIX is currently at 43 after a 7% SPY move. These are unfuckingprecedented times people.\n\nLike all TA gays, I'm here to tell you that price could go up, but there's an absolutely beautiful technical setup for a massive implosion.",

The 200 week moving average has been support for this entire bull market - 9 fucking years!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/qe68eao0jbr41.png?width=1044&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=2640b176655d0341604e956532613eed2af27490\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/qe68eao0jbr41.png?width=1044&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=2640b176655d0341604e956532613eed2af27490&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second, it&amp;#39;s the .382 Fib of the entire price decline from the all time high. The two line up perfectly. When a structural support (resistance) and a major fib line up, it&amp;#39;s like wearing two condoms during gay sex - little jimmy has to work way harder to impregnate your boyfriend&amp;#39;s sister&amp;#39;s husband.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;![img](7od46vbjibr41 &amp;quot;Second, it&amp;#39;s the .382 Fib of this entire decline.\n&amp;quot;)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now look at the price action:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/6be97modjbr41.png?width=1346&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=51ddf004701b380f9f67e8ec6f3797dea975dd4a\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/6be97modjbr41.png?width=1346&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=51ddf004701b380f9f67e8ec6f3797dea975dd4a&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In a bull market, this would be hella bullish price action - price banging on the door, eventually breaking it down. But we&amp;#39;re not in a bull market are we? Hellllll no we&amp;#39;re not.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In a bull market, an impulse gap like the one we had this morning above a previous short term trend of the previous move (see the red line drawn from the ATH) would be on high volume.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Check out this pitiful volume today:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/bwkoouzxjbr41.png?width=1346&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=e55cad6e16a52e32f68c14a581211ce8222f05d0\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/bwkoouzxjbr41.png?width=1346&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=e55cad6e16a52e32f68c14a581211ce8222f05d0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just sad, sad volume for a gap impulse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, factor in where we closed. RIGHT at the 200 weekly MA. Not above it. the final minute saw HUGE sell volumes into the close.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/v71xmxsbkbr41.png?width=1346&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=d5a134ebbc82de1050f2cd145df0e8dacb25a577\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/v71xmxsbkbr41.png?width=1346&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=d5a134ebbc82de1050f2cd145df0e8dacb25a577&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now look, I&amp;#39;m not saying price can&amp;#39;t continue up further. It absolutely could. There have been enormous short positioned established in the past two weeks which will put upward pressure on prices and could carry price to $270-280 if we break above $264 with high volume.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BUT, if we fail here for the THIRD time. The selling is going to be absolutely vicious. 20 day realized volatility is 100. ONE FUCKING HUNDRED. UNFUCKING PRECEDENTED. The VIX is currently at 43 after a 7% SPY move. These are unfuckingprecedented times people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like all TA gays, I&amp;#39;m here to tell you that price could go up, but there&amp;#39;s an absolutely beautiful technical setup for a massive implosion.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

          "selftext": "These are my claims from looking at the virus data myself:\n\n1. The number of new cases US-wide is indeed plateauing. But don't get too bull happy. To be clear, this means that **the \\*rate\\* of new cases will no longer increase as we have seen**. This is a consequence of social distancing put in place \\~13 March (24 days ago). Following the incubation period (4-12 range, mean 5) and duration of symptoms (10-14 days), this makes sense. Lombardi, Italy, began practicing social distancing around 28 Feb and the data shows that they also flattened the \\*rate\\* of new cases by March 18 (22 days).\n2. **There is a medium-pace and steady descent in new cases once the rate plateaus**. Not groundbreaking, but at what rate does it descend? In Lombardi from 20 March to 06 April (17 days), the number of new cases per day dropped steadily from zero (plateau) to \\~60%, specifically from \\~2400 to \\~1080 new cases per day. On a NY/US timeline, this means that the number of new cases per day will drop in NY from \\~20,000 (the current plateau) to \\~8,000/day and in the US from \\~30,000 to \\~12,000. In total cases that translates to \\~250,000 in NY and \\~800,000 in the US on 23 April. Bookmark this shit. My estimate 2 weeks ago was that the US would get between 400,000-700,000 cases. My estimate was too low.\n3. Ahead I am going to explain what is probably the most important phenomena that virtually everyone overlooks when interpreting that virus data. **Number of new tests must be considered to interpret something credible from number of new cases**. **Hence, the steep drop of new cases that occurred over Sat, 04 April and Sun, 05 April was largely due to the coinciding drop in new tests.** Sites such as Johns Hopkins and World-meters do not include new tests, so autists and non-autists alike are  wrongly led to believe that the number of new cases nosedived.  I argue that it is because the number of new tests plummeted, not \\*necessarily\\* the number of new cases. The inverse is also true.  (To the naysayers, positivity rate is 45% in NY, so it follows that more people would test positive if more tests were readily available, and vice versa.)\n\nWhy is this significant? This is big, so stay with me. The number of reported new cases dropped from 23,101 to 18,659 from last Saturday to Sunday. That’s a 23% drop. Everyone looking at that leans optimistic and the bull parade is initiated. But-- \\*There was concurrently a 19% drop in new tests. On Sunday night Trump tweets “light at the end of the tunnel”. The market rallies Monday morning 7%. **New tests are not properly being accounted for by the general audience to follow the new cases trend line.** The statisticians who know this are not explaining the nuances to the general public. Have you noticed how no statistical expert has declared an apex or plateau?\n\nStill don’t buy it? The exact same scenario happened a weekend ago. There was a 15% drop in new tests from Sat-Sun and the market rallied 4% on Monday morning. The weekend before that? There actually wasn’t a significant drop in new tests; there was an increase over the weekend as US testing was ramping up. On Monday the market responded red. No new test reduction = no new case reduction = no green Monday.\n\nMy guess is that there is a logistic factor occurring over Saturday and Sunday to explain the drop in new tests over the weekend.\n\nFurther evidence--. Remember on March 24th when Trump said on the White House lawn that the country would be open in Easter. There was a 23% reduction in newly reported tests that day (and, of course, a -16% reduction in newly reported cases).\n\nLast point then I have my final and practical takeaway. When the number of new tests/new cases drop, it shoots up the day and/or two. On Tuesday, March 31 new tests in NY increased 33% from the previous day. The SPY closed lower that Tuesday (-1.5%) and Wednesday (-4.3%) . Two days after trumps Easter comment, on March 26th, new tests day over day increased 53%. The Spy responded by dropping -3.6%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFollow the logic with me:\n\n1. The SPY is corresponding to the number of new cases.\n2. The number of new cases is corresponding to the number of new tests.\n3. The number of new tests slumps occasionally ( I've observed a pattern of weekend slumping).\n4. So, tests slump = cases slump = SPY moons\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Corollary:\n\n5) New tests revert to the mean after a slump, effectively bouncing back\n\n6) Following (2) from above, daily new cases rise on a relative basis\n\n7) SPY bleeds, because tests rally = cases rally = SPY diggs\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBulls should play 1-4, bears play 5-7. Specifically, that means\n\nBULL ACTION-- Load up on longs when the number of new tests shoots substantially above the mean because a drop in new tests/cases is likely 1-2 days ahead. Since weekends are days with lower new tests, Friday at 3pm works (assuming no bombshell news is reported over the weekend).\n\nBEAR ACTION-- Short the market when the new tests drop, like right now, on Monday 4/6\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nData source:\n\nUS :[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/2/d/e/2PACX-1vRwAqp96T9sYYq2-i7Tj0pvTf6XVHjDSMIKBdZHXiCGGdNC0ypEU9NbngS8mxea55JuCFuua1MUeOj5/pubhtml#](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/2/d/e/2PACX-1vRwAqp96T9sYYq2-i7Tj0pvTf6XVHjDSMIKBdZHXiCGGdNC0ypEU9NbngS8mxea55JuCFuua1MUeOj5/pubhtml#)\n\nItaly: [https://github.com/pcm-dpc/COVID-19/tree/master/schede-riepilogative/regioni](https://github.com/pcm-dpc/COVID-19/tree/master/schede-riepilogative/regioni)\n\nedit: Some of you are requesting data that shows new tests / new cases.

But don&amp;#39;t get too bull happy. To be clear, this means that &lt;strong&gt;the *rate* of new cases will no longer increase as we have seen&lt;/strong&gt;. This is a consequence of social distancing put in place ~13 March (24 days ago). Following the incubation period (4-12 range, mean 5) and duration of symptoms (10-14 days), this makes sense. Lombardi, Italy, began practicing social distancing around 28 Feb and the data shows that they also flattened the *rate* of new cases by March 18 (22 days).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is a medium-pace and steady descent in new cases once the rate plateaus&lt;/strong&gt;. Not groundbreaking, but at what rate does it descend? In Lombardi from 20 March to 06 April (17 days), the number of new cases per day dropped steadily from zero (plateau) to ~60%, specifically from ~2400 to ~1080 new cases per day. On a NY/US timeline, this means that the number of new cases per day will drop in NY from ~20,000 (the current plateau) to ~8,000/day and in the US from ~30,000 to ~12,000. In total cases that translates to ~250,000 in NY and ~800,000 in the US on 23 April. Bookmark this shit. My estimate 2 weeks ago was that the US would get between 400,000-700,000 cases. My estimate was too low.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ahead I am going to explain what is probably the most important phenomena that virtually everyone overlooks when interpreting that virus data. &lt;strong&gt;Number of new tests must be considered to interpret something credible from number of new cases&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Hence, the steep drop of new cases that occurred over Sat, 04 April and Sun, 05 April was largely due to the coinciding drop in new tests.&lt;/strong&gt; Sites such as Johns Hopkins and World-meters do not include new tests, so autists and non-autists alike are  wrongly led to believe that the number of new cases nosedived.  I argue that it is because the number of new tests plummeted, not *necessarily* the number of new cases. The inverse is also true.  (To the naysayers, positivity rate is 45% in NY, so it follows that more people would test positive if more tests were readily available, and vice versa.)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why is this significant? This is big, so stay with me. The number of reported new cases dropped from 23,101 to 18,659 from last Saturday to Sunday. That’s a 23% drop. Everyone looking at that leans optimistic and the bull parade is initiated. But-- *There was concurrently a 19% drop in new tests. On Sunday night Trump tweets “light at the end of the tunnel”. The market rallies Monday morning 7%. &lt;strong&gt;New tests are not properly being accounted for by the general audience to follow the new cases trend line.&lt;/strong&gt; The statisticians who know this are not explaining the nuances to the general public.

Never happened. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So could we have bottomed? Certainly possible. Any one who says they know is full of shit. Personally, I think it&amp;#39;s pretty unlikely. But for all of you cocky bulls talking shit about how this is the end of the bears and it&amp;#39;s all up from here, let&amp;#39;s consider something:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;S&amp;amp;P 500:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;08/28/2000 - 1,520&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;04/02/2001 - 1,128&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;05/14/2001 - 1,292&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;09/17/2001 - 966&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;12/31/2001 - 1,173&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;09/30/2002 - 801 (bottom)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;10/08/2007 - 1,562&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;03/10/2008 - 1,288&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;05/12/2008 - 1,425&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;11/17/2008 - 800&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;12/19/2008 - 932&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;03/02/2009 - 683 (bottom)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;02/10/2020 - 3,380&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;03/16/2020 - 2,305&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;03/23/2020 - 2,541&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;04/06/2020 - 2,664&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In neither 2001 or 2008 were we facing the same magnitude of fundamental problems to the economic or financial system as we do today. Not even close. You think this is a recovery? 2\n300 fucking points?
