The event will sell tickets to host a live audience of approximately 2,500 people, and will also be live streamed, available online through pay-per-view.\n\nYou can learn more about it by visiting:\n#**[wallstreetbets.net](https://wallstreetbets.net)**\n\n#**Why will it be in Texas?**\n\nESA is the newest and biggest Esports venue in the US.  It’s a facility that was built specifically for esports and has all the latest technology and infrastructure which is needed to host this type of event. \n\n#**Is it real**?\n\nYes.  Here are some reputable news sources that have written about it:\n\n* [Nobody Wants a Margin Call Right Now]( https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2020-03-26/money-stuff-nobody-wants-a-margin-call-right-now) - Bloomberg (by Matt Levine)\n\n* [Esports Stadium Arlington to Host Stock Options Trading Championship]( https://esportsobserver.com/esports-stadium-arlington-wsb) – Esports Observer\n\n* [Wild markets set stage for winner-take-all trading competition]( https://www.investmentnews.com/wild-markets-trading-competition-190598) - Investment News\n\n* WSB Announces First Live Trading Championship – (Press Release) found on [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wallstreetbets-announces-first-live-trading-110000567.html), [AP](https://apnews.com/Business%20Wire/44bde858888d487c85e29a442c1ede6a), [Street Insider](https://www.streetinsider.com/Business+Wire/WallStreetBets+Announces+First+Live+Trading+Championship/16665169.html), [Market Screener](https://www.marketscreener.com/news/WallStreetBets-Announces-First-Live-Trading-Championship--30256362/), [BusinessWire](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200326005099/en/WallStreetBets-Announces-Live-Trading-Championship), [Digital Journal](http://www.digitaljournal.com/pr/4633412), [Benzinga](https://www.benzinga.com/pressreleases/20/03/b15670385/wallstreetbets-announces-first-live-trading-championship)\n\n#**How will the contestants be picked? How can I apply?**\n\nWe will open up contestant applications in the coming weeks along with any requirements (relevant citizenship, 18 years old, etc…).  At that point we will also list out the rules and criteria which will used for the selection.  There will be “qualifier rounds” which will be fully transparent and open to the public to watch.  At the end of the process, we will have the final contestants for the WSB Championship.\n\nContestants will deposit a predetermined amount of money into a personal broker account which will be used for the competition.  Anything they make (or lose) during the competition will be theirs, in addition to the prize money awarded to the winner.\n\n#**What’s the prize?**\n\nThe prize will be big, between 6 and 7 figures.  The final amount will be announced in the coming weeks.\n\n#**How are you paying for it?**\n\nThe prize money is coming from the primary sponsor of the event, [True Trading Group]( https://truetradinggroup.com/wallstreetbets/?cc=WSBTTG&amp;cp=30).  This has been mentioned in all the press releases linked above:  \n&gt; True Trading Group (TTG) will provide the proceeds for the WSB Championship prize.\n\n#**What about the beer virus?**\n\nWe’re seriously hoping that COVID-19 is under control by October, in which case we will proceed with the live audience.  But if there are any sort of restrictions in place by then, the entire event will also be streamed online.\n\n#**Do you have a lawyer?**\n\nYes.  Many of them.\n\n#**You’re going to get options banned for everyone**\n\nDerivative market is 17 times greater than the actual equities market.  Estimated to be around $1.2 quadrillion dollars globally (although not all with options).  If 12 people get together and legally trade them for a couple days shuts down that market, then the financial system has bigger problems on its hands than WSB. \n\n\n\n#**STFU and change the logo!** \n\nI hear you, we’re fixing the logo. I’ll be making a post about that this weekend.",

This has been mentioned in all the press releases linked above:  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;True Trading Group (TTG) will provide the proceeds for the WSB Championship prize.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about the beer virus?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We’re seriously hoping that COVID-19 is under control by October, in which case we will proceed with the live audience.  But if there are any sort of restrictions in place by then, the entire event will also be streamed online.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have a lawyer?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes.  Many of them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’re going to get options banned for everyone&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Derivative market is 17 times greater than the actual equities market.  Estimated to be around $1.2 quadrillion dollars globally (although not all with options).  If 12 people get together and legally trade them for a couple days shuts down that market, then the financial system has bigger problems on its hands than WSB. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STFU and change the logo!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hear you, we’re fixing the logo. I’ll be making a post about that this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

If you want to shoot me a DM, I’m all for it.\n\nNational Suicide Prevention Hotline\n\n1-800-273-8255\n\nwww.GamblersAnonymous.org\n\nMany of us are new on this specific sub. Taking a moment to think, I cannot figure one sub on all of Reddit like it. This sub is so unique and so powerful. It brings together the very poor and the very wealthy. The risk takers and the risk adverse. Nuclear physicists and cocaine dealers. Old and young, of all races, shapes, and sizes. \nWall Street Bets and the market have zero biases. The intelligent can lose everything, the autists can make extraordinary gains.\n\nWe see it week after week. \n\n10k to 100k\n50k to 800k\nI just saw a post where a guy said $60 took him to 90k in 2 months and one where a guy took $900 to 18k in 15 minutes. \n\nWe are living in a time where a near infinite amount of money is changing hands at an unfathomable pace. \n\nWe can make life-changing gains in what feels like a few revolutions of the Earth on its axis. \n\nWith that being said...\n\nWhere there are huge gains, there are going to be huge losses. Most of you on this thread are losing money. By most, I would estimate 75%-85%. Some of you are new here, some of you have been here a while and can’t figure it out.\n\nI want to say, from my own great and tragic experience... it’s okay. Some of life’s most peaceful moments don’t require anything but a desire. It does not require money to go sit down by the creek and listen to the water pour through the rock bed. You don’t need money to go out into the woods and listen to nature speak specifically to you. \n\nYou have the choice from this very moment forward to due your diligence and learn why some people are making thousands of dollars each trade, over and over again, 60%+ of the time.\n\nSome of you coming from a sports betting background, a poker background, a bartering background. You wouldn’t go into a game or a trade without knowing who’s playing, or what the value of each item was worth would you? Use your ability to scan a valuable situation to your advantage.\n\nSome of you come from a mathematical, engineering, or physics background. You wouldn’t try to solve a problem with no tools, history basis, or outside sources would you? Use your ability to problem solve and reverse engineer to figure out where we are, how we got here, and how it appears we are going to move forward.\n\nWe have artists, and dancers, and musicians, and tradesmen. Use your precision for the technical aspects in your everyday trading.\n\nMost importantly, be as patient as a tiger stalking its prey. Some people will get super lucky. Most will not. This is not free and you will most likely, not get a free pass.\n\nI share this in an attempt to grab the focus of a group of people who see this as a possibility to leave a life of financial troubles behind, and those who want to build on a profitable future. \n\nI am not providing you with any financial advice, or technical analysis. I will see the respect in those of you who call me a fellow autist or ask for me to get banned. At first I didn’t understand the humor here, but I have found myself laughing profusely at this forum and I love it. But with the humor, you have to find the moments to be serious and that is when your hard earned money and your priceless time is involved.\n\nIf anyone is looking for a mentee, I’m looking for a mentor or group of like minded people who want to discuss both financials, and overcoming challenges on a daily basis. Drop me a line.\n\nFor the rest of you, happy trading, stay safe, and figure good fortunes for yourself.\n\nPositions:\n\nSpy $220p 5/15",

Remember how slow the Fed normally acts it’s policies. \n\nThis time they’re scared... Market crashes are annoying yes, but they’re part of the economic cycle. The Fed is shitting their pants about this market crash. But why? \n\nTrump and Fed keep reiterating this is NOT A financial crisis but a medical crisis. I call bull shit. The Fed has had to run repo operations to maintain liquidity in the repo markets these last couple years with intense programs recently. Something is not right in the financial system\n\nThink of a house plumbing system, water flows smoothly— “A” OK—water gets blocked somewhere—KABOOM \n\nMoney flow is being blocked somewhere in the financial system\n\nJPM was the likely cause this time just a few months ago when repo rates jumped 10%\n\nJPM declared it was because of reserve ratio laws enacted since 2008 and tax payments withholding that they had to stop loaning money in the repo market where the Fed had to step in and unplug the block \n\nRemember the Fed has now lowered reserve ratios to 0. Interest rates 0. They’re now buying fucking ETF’s \n\nThis shows the Fed is extremely worried about something in the market \n\nThere is a pile of dog shit somewhere in the financial system, similar to CDO’s of 2008\n\nMight be the corporate bonds that banks don’t want as collateral in the repo market causing a freeze, in which case the Fed steps into buy them. But I think corporate bonds are just a spark to the real gasoline lying in the financial markets—ETF’s \n\nWSB God Michael Burry compared ETF’s to CDO’s \n\n[Michael Burry compares ETF’s to CDO’s](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2019-09-04/michael-burry-explains-why-index-funds-are-like-subprime-cdos)\n\n\n[Research paper—ETF’s account for 10% of Market but 20% of short interest](https://jacobslevycenter.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ETF-Short-Interest-and-Failures-to-Deliver.pdf)\n\nAnd a very controversial article by Andrew Bogan pHD. \n\n[Can ETF’s collapse](http://boganassociates.com/whitepapers.html)\n\nThis shit is over my autistic head but some loophole of ETF shorting involved with stock creation and redemption can cause them to collapse quickly under intense selling pressure. Which means they can’t handle an aggressive bear market. \n\nSo...\n\nWhy is the Fed all of the sudden stepping in to buy corporate bond ETF’s and throwing the kitchen sink at the problem? They are literally shaking in their boots. JPow, Fed Chair, doing an interview on the Today show FFS to reassure the American people \n\nI think it’s because ETF’s have produced the capability for a MASSIVE stock market crash, likes of which we’ve never seen \n\nAll it takes is a spark: Let’s call it Beer flu \n\nBeer flu hits—economy halts, corporate bonds become a hot potato, nobody wants to hold. Repo market freezes at points where corporate bonds are collateral. Liquidity crisis ensues. \n\nFed needs to fix this and contain this quickly \n\nOr else this hits the broader market and causes ETF’s to collapse \n\nNow why would the Fed care so much about ETF’s? They’re just another ol’ financial product out of thousands on the market, and all they do is track the real market \n\nI think it has something to do with the ETF custodians\n\nIf they fail, for example if SPY fails, their custodian, in this case State Street Corp and a bank considered “too big to fail,” could fall. BlackRock, Vanguard, are custodians to iShares and Vanguard index’s. \n\n*My wild card gamble:*\n\nCall me crazy... BUT \n\nState Street Bank had its stress test, the Fed passed them, but told them they’d be at risk of bankruptcy if under market stress their largest trading partner or counterparty defaulted—Fed doesn’t say who this is, and they know sensitive information about all these players \n\nCurrent market conditions under beer flu are WORSE then the Feds stress test—meaning State Streets counterparty could be in big trouble of defaulting as Fed has pointed out \n\nScenario: \n\nCoronavirus causes corporate bonds to go to shit, repo market freezes, liquidity dries up, volatility takes off\n\nIntense shorting of SPY ETF could cause a counterparty Authorized Participant (AP) of State Street to collapse—this could be a market maker or other financial institution that’s working with State Street in the creation and redemption process which maintains SPY.\n\nState Street is considered too big to fail. Meaning if they fall, it would cause global shock to the financial systems \n\nMy hunch says, SPY ETF is at risk and so is State Street if market volatility picks up beyond a certain threshold which causes the ETF to collapse \n\nThe Fed is buying individual corporate bonds and corporate bond ETF’s as a way to prop the markets collectively but doing so in a way that doesn’t point to the true problem they have—ETF collapses in a bear market—causing “Too big to fail” banks to collapse\n\nTl;dr: The very nature of ETF creation and redemption mechanism makes it susceptible to easily collapse under extreme selling. Michael Burry compares ETF’s to CDO’s of 2008. SPY ETF and it’s custodian State Street could be at risk. Probably why the Fed is acting wildly to protect ETF liquidity. \n\nNo formal positions yet \n\n12/08 SPY $100 P\n\nSTT long dated puts \n\nVCSH and LQD calls when market price under Net Asset Value and money printer goes BRRRR",

BUT &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;State Street Bank had its stress test, the Fed passed them, but told them they’d be at risk of bankruptcy if under market stress their largest trading partner or counterparty defaulted—Fed doesn’t say who this is, and they know sensitive information about all these players &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Current market conditions under beer flu are WORSE then the Feds stress test—meaning State Streets counterparty could be in big trouble of defaulting as Fed has pointed out &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Scenario: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Coronavirus causes corporate bonds to go to shit, repo market freezes, liquidity dries up, volatility takes off&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Intense shorting of SPY ETF could cause a counterparty Authorized Participant (AP) of State Street to collapse—this could be a market maker or other financial institution that’s working with State Street in the creation and redemption process which maintains SPY.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;State Street is considered too big to fail. Meaning if they fall, it would cause global shock to the financial systems &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My hunch says, SPY ETF is at risk and so is State Street if market volatility picks up beyond a certain threshold which causes the ETF to collapse &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Fed is buying individual corporate bonds and corporate bond ETF’s as a way to prop the markets collectively but doing so in a way that doesn’t point to the true problem they have—ETF collapses in a bear market—causing “Too big to fail” banks to collapse&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tl;dr: The very nature of ETF creation and redemption mechanism makes it susceptible to easily collapse under extreme selling. Michael Burry compares ETF’s to CDO’s of 2008. SPY ETF and it’s custodian State Street could be at risk. Probably why the Fed is acting wildly to protect ETF liquidity. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No formal positions yet &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;12/08 SPY $100 P&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;STT long dated puts &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;VCSH and LQD calls when market price under Net Asset Value and money printer goes BRRRR&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
