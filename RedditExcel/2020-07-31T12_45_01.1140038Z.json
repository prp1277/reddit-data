I decided to change the paper size to 6x9. Word has a PageSetup object in the VBA reference at MS Office Dev Center here: &lt;a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/api/word.pagesetup.pageheight\"&gt;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/api/word.pagesetup.pageheight&lt;/a&gt;.  I had tried this but it looks like Excel doesn&amp;#39;t use that same format for setting the page size so this generates a compile error.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    With wordDoc.PageSetup              &amp;#39;72 points = 1 inch\n        .BottomMargin = 72              &amp;#39;1&amp;quot;\n        .TopMargin = 63                 &amp;#39;0.88&amp;quot;\n        .LeftMargin = 62                &amp;#39;0.86&amp;quot;\n        .RightMargin = 63               &amp;#39;0.88&amp;quot;\n        .PageHeight = InchesToPoints(9) &amp;#39;9&amp;quot; tall\n        .PageWidth = InchesToPoints(6)  &amp;#39;6&amp;quot; wide\n    End With\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I see Excel has a PageSize.PaperSize = xlPaperSize setting where one can set the value to xlPaperUser but with no clarity on how to use that to set the size to any specific size.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Can someone tell me how to adjust this to change the paper size to 6x9?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","likes":null,"suggested_sort":"top","banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"no_follow":true,"is_crosspostable":false,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"link_flair_template_id":"347a72ac-d515-11e1-ace2-12313d051e91","can_gild":false,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":"1","treatment_tags":[],"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qur2","mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"#cc6666","id":"i16if4","is_robot_indexable":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"franks-and-beans","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":0,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","contest_mode":false,"mod_reports":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":"light","permalink":"/r/excel/comments/i16if4/how_to_set_page_size_when_outputting_excel_data/","parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","stickied":false,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/i16if4/how_to_set_page_size_when_outputting_excel_data/","subreddit_subscribers":205068,"created_utc":1596197858.0,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false}},{"kind":"t3","data":{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"excel","selftext":"I need something that can take 2 known numbers and solve for an unknown 3rd number to have a total average of 95.\nI know how to do it in Solver and in Goal Seek, but I need it to be in a formula or function.\nFor example:\nStudent has grades of 56 and 85.

Does anyone know of a way to calculate the difference between values based on the pivot table data? The data i&amp;#39;m trying to calculate the difference between is the 2 circled parts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What i&amp;#39;m trying to discover is how many more or less we&amp;#39;ve sold of each item between 2 years. It&amp;#39;s not a direct row by row calculation, it needs to follow the naming convention provided in the table so we know that if we took the first item in the table as an example that the total that&amp;#39;s been provided is the total from 2019 - the total from 2018 for that specific item.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hopefully I&amp;#39;ve explained it well enough... Many thanks for the help.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/o8mfq1cfu5e51.png?width=748&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=37c8b38a6645fbdc2d06fa35416240f5e6f4f287\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/o8mfq1cfu5e51.png?width=748&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=37c8b38a6645fbdc2d06fa35416240f5e6f4f287&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","likes":null,"suggested_sort":"top","banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"no_follow":true,"is_crosspostable":false,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"link_flair_template_id":"9d157000-a29e-11ea-b1e3-0e2704c7c361","can_gild":false,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qur2","mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"#cc6666","id":"i14cx4","is_robot_indexable":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"BlackStarLine15","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":5,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","contest_mode":false,"mod_reports":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"/r/excel/comments/i14cx4/calculating_data_between_2_different_pivot_tables/","parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","stickied":false,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/i14cx4/calculating_data_between_2_different_pivot_tables/","subreddit_subscribers":205068,"created_utc":1596186501.0,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false}},{"kind":"t3","data":{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"excel","selftext":"Hi all,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntitle is probably misleading.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've made a cashflow forecast graph, which includes actual and forecast:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ezejyi9sm4e51.png?width=607&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb30ef32eae99e4893ae2b1c7e0e6544175590b7\n\nI feel like the \"actual\" line looks out of place after the current date as it's just a straight line.
