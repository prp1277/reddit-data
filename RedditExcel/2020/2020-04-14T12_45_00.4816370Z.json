          "selftext": "Flagged as discussion, because I'm hoping to have a much broader discussion of PQ and where to begin. As some background, I have about 14 years experience with Excel, and I started with VBA very, very early on. I've done pretty much everything with VBA short of scraping websites. I have no patience for PQ because I can write the VBA faster than I can figure out PQ. I'm determined to change that.\n\nScenario:\n\nI have two large reports (200K rows, 45 columns) spitting out of a database. I have no access to the database, so I'm stuck with the reports I'm given. Each report tracks vendor performance for different services. These are not combined in any way, and they each have their own criteria. Both reports are split into individual reports for Vender/Service. These individual reports have one vendor, one service per report.\n\nGoal:\n\nCreate individual report files, breaking out the above data based on given criteria. Dump the raw data into one sheet, and create a couple of summary worksheets of the data - one is summary data by location, one would look at total performance against expectations. I'm currently doing this with VBA, so it's not a problem if creating individual reports can't happen. If I can use PQ for similar summaries (dashboard, basically) I'll be happy.\n\nData Layout:\n\nMy criteria table looks like this:\n\nID| Vendor | Services | VendorID | JobCode\n---|---|----|----|----|----\n\nOnly the VendorID and JobCode are in the raw report. Some individual reports have multiple JobCodes. So that SQL would something like WHERE VendorID = 2 AND (JobCode = 'JC1\" OR JobCode = 'JC2\")\n\nPertinent fields of the raw report:\n\nVendorID | JobCode | Building | Month | Type | Sum1 | Sum2\n---|---|----|----|----|----|---\n\nSum1 and Sum2 are just sample fields of the data to be summarized / transformed. There's really about 30 of them. 'Building' is a grouping for how individual reports would look. I currently have them set up like (repeating for each building present for that report):\n\nBuilding1 | Month1 | Month2 | Total\n---|---|---|---\nType1 |--|--|-- \nType 2 |-|--|--\nType 3|-|--|--\nTotal |-|--|--\n\nSo, with the layout and goals (individual reports, plus a larger dashboard for all data), can I:\n\n * Use PQ with a criteria table? Is that at all complicated with a single requirement for one field, and multiple matches for a second field?\n\nI found [this](https://exceloffthegrid.com/power-query-using-parameters/), but the directions didn't work for me. It says to remove the columns after adding the criteria, but then I can't go in and edit the query ('drilldown' as the instructions calls it) if I do that. And I didn't have the option to 'drilldown' on the second criteria that I tested it with. I also had limited time, but I get frustrated with an inability to figure out what should be really simple, especially when there's a guide to follow.\n\n * Use PQ to create individual report fires? Is this at all complicated by a variable number of buildings? Some have 1, some have 12. I'm doing it all dynamically with VBA (For i = 1 to Buildings.Count) so it's no big deal if I can't.\n\n * With the above layouts, can I use fields from the *Criteria* table to drive a dashboard? So if I want to look at a single vendor across all services, that would be pretty easy I think. What if I want to look at a specific service across all vendors? I imagine this is just a dropdown or slicer for the data Does this require a 'merge' when I do the initial query? When working with 200K rows and 45 columns, am I looking at a  really bad time with a merge?\n\nAnything else you see or want to point out, feel free. If I need to explain something, just let me know. PQ is one of the last items on my list to learn, and I'm determined to build a killer dashboard with it.",

These individual reports have one vendor, one service per report.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Goal:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Create individual report files, breaking out the above data based on given criteria. Dump the raw data into one sheet, and create a couple of summary worksheets of the data - one is summary data by location, one would look at total performance against expectations. I&amp;#39;m currently doing this with VBA, so it&amp;#39;s not a problem if creating individual reports can&amp;#39;t happen. If I can use PQ for similar summaries (dashboard, basically) I&amp;#39;ll be happy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Data Layout:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My criteria table looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;ID&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Vendor&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Services&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;VendorID&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;JobCode&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Only the VendorID and JobCode are in the raw report. Some individual reports have multiple JobCodes. So that SQL would something like WHERE VendorID = 2 AND (JobCode = &amp;#39;JC1&amp;quot; OR JobCode = &amp;#39;JC2&amp;quot;)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pertinent fields of the raw report:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;VendorID&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;JobCode&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Building&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Month&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Type&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Sum1&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Sum2&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sum1 and Sum2 are just sample fields of the data to be summarized / transformed. There&amp;#39;s really about 30 of them. &amp;#39;Building&amp;#39; is a grouping for how individual reports would look. I currently have them set up like (repeating for each building present for that report):&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Building1&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Month1&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Month2&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Total&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;Type1&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;--&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;--&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;--&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;Type 2&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;-&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;--&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;--&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;Type 3&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;-&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;--&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;--&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;Total&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;-&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;--&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;--&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, with the layout and goals (individual reports, plus a larger dashboard for all data), can I:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Use PQ with a criteria table? Is that at all complicated with a single requirement for one field, and multiple matches for a second field?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I found &lt;a href=\"https://exceloffthegrid.com/power-query-using-parameters/\"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, but the directions didn&amp;#39;t work for me. It says to remove the columns after adding the criteria, but then I can&amp;#39;t go in and edit the query (&amp;#39;drilldown&amp;#39; as the instructions calls it) if I do that. And I didn&amp;#39;t have the option to &amp;#39;drilldown&amp;#39; on the second criteria that I tested it with. I also had limited time, but I get frustrated with an inability to figure out what should be really simple, especially when there&amp;#39;s a guide to follow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use PQ to create individual report fires? Is this at all complicated by a variable number of buildings? Some have 1, some have 12. I&amp;#39;m doing it all dynamically with VBA (For i = 1 to Buildings.Count) so it&amp;#39;s no big deal if I can&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the above layouts, can I use fields from the &lt;em&gt;Criteria&lt;/em&gt; table to drive a dashboard? So if I want to look at a single vendor across all services, that would be pretty easy I think. What if I want to look at a specific service across all vendors? I imagine this is just a dropdown or slicer for the data Does this require a &amp;#39;merge&amp;#39; when I do the initial query? When working with 200K rows and 45 columns, am I looking at a  really bad time with a merge?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anything else you see or want to point out, feel free. If I need to explain something, just let me know. PQ is one of the last items on my list to learn, and I&amp;#39;m determined to build a killer dashboard with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Projected Success of the new product\n2. Projected failure of the new product\n3. Survey does not give conclusive results\n\nPrevious surveys have predicted potential sales in the following order:\n\nWhen a product has high potential sales the survey predicted:\n\n|Success|80.0%|\n|:-|:-|\n|Failure|10.0%|\n|Non conclusive|10.0%|\n\nWhen a product has regular potential sales the survey predicted:\n\n|Success|50.0%|\n|:-|:-|\n|Failure|40.0%|\n|Non conclusive|20.0%|\n\nWhen a product has low potential sales the survey predicted:\n\n|Success|15.0%|\n|:-|:-|\n|Failure|70.0%|\n|Non conclusive|15.0%|\n\nWhat I need to figure out. \n\n&gt;Raise a decision tree that defines the current situation  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Would you apply the survey and why?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Would you introduce the new product and why?",
