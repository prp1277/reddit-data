I'll make an example using school subjects.\n\nSay, for example, that the free-form source reports are about high school classes, wherein each teacher listed down what they did that day and how the lesson went. Then what we need our people to do is:\n\n- enter the subject and class year (eg \"Year 4 physics\")\n\n- enter the topics connected to that specific subject and class year (eg \"Ohm's laws\" and \"Kircfhoff's laws\")\n\n(The way the data presently exists is unfortunately such that it's impossible to extract the information automatically with any degree of accuracy)\n\nThe snag is that our data validation needs to dynamically change to account for this relationship: once the user has selected \"Year 4 physics\", the \"topics\" column must only present a choice of and accept topics connected to \"Year 4 physics\". It must neither present as a choice nor accept if otherwise entered topics that are not listed under \"Year 4 physics\". If a teacher mistakenly tries to enter a topic like \"Quadratic equations\" under \"Year 4 physics\", the data validation needs to reject it.\n\n#My current attempt and where it falls short\n\nWe already have a full list of subjects and their connected topics. I've already made a first-draft module that uses data validation with dynamic rules. This is my current data validation formula:\n\n    =INDIRECT(LEFT(I2;FIND(\" \";I2)-1))\n\nColumn I contains the \"Year Subject\" data as entered by the user. The above formula returns that string, which is the same as the name of the range containing the appropriate data validation list.\n\nFor example, if cell I2 contains the string \"Year 4 physics\", then this formula returns \"Year 4 physics\". As a result, data validation will use the range titled \"Year 4 physics\" as its data validation list. This allows the data validation to be dynamic, as per specification.\n\nWhere this falls short is that the user has to then either remember exactly every subject allowed under data validation, or use the data validation dropdown to tediously scroll through until they find the right value. In testing, this has proven way too long a process, even for a trained user.\n\n#My attempt at a solution and where I got stuck\n\nSo then I immediately thought about using the well documented method of creating a ComboBox with Search As You Type. The user could then type rather than scroll through the data validation selection, and the SAYT function would quickly get them the string they need, without needing to remember exactly how it's written.\n\nThe problem I can't find how to make this dynamic. Simply leaving the data validation with the same formula as above results in an empty ComboBox list.

This formula works fine and I have no problems with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The issue I have is for the oncoming shift date. I currently have this formula in I32 =IF(O3=6,C32+3,(IF(P3&amp;gt;(--&amp;quot;17:30:00&amp;quot;),Q3+1, Q3)))&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On a Friday there is no late shift, so the oncoming shift after a Friday will always be on the following Monday, hence why it looks at the Weekday in O3 and returns the correct date for the following Monday. This part is fine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It the next part of the formula I&amp;#39;m having issues with, if it&amp;#39;s not a Friday, so when O3 is less than 6, it will always return a date of Q3+1, even when the time is &amp;lt;17:30.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any help to fix this is greatly welcomed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","likes":null,"suggested_sort":"top","banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"no_follow":true,"is_crosspostable":false,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"link_flair_template_id":"2ba72878-d515-11e1-821b-12313d051e91","can_gild":false,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qur2","mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"#669999","id":"hil62v","is_robot_indexable":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"davidsdungeon","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":3,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","contest_mode":false,"mod_reports":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"/r/excel/comments/hil62v/automatic_date_changing_not_working_correctly/","parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","stickied":false,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/hil62v/automatic_date_changing_not_working_correctly/","subreddit_subscribers":200820,"created_utc":1593514720.0,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false}},{"kind":"t3","data":{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"excel","selftext":"Hi,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have a list of numbers in column A.
