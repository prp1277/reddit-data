The user will not require access as there are pivot tables in place, but if he/she does, I want to be able to extract the data.\n\nThis is where my problem starts. Should I make a copy of the database? or should I copy the data to an excel sheet?\n\nIssues i foresee and unanswered questions in my head;\n\n1.Excel only has a limited number of rows, If my database exceeds that it wont be able to perform the transaction\n\n2. I could give a copy of the access database (unprotected), but access is sort of rubbish with analysing any sort of data and I think any user who wants to extract this data for any reason other than a backup may want to analyse it in there own way.\n\n3. As data builds up they may want to rebuild the database. i.e backup the db and clear all the entries to sort of start fresh in that case should I give it as a copy of the access db?\n\n4. Maximum capacity of Access is 2gb. How much is 2gb??? I have around 5 tables out of which i expect 2 of them to get populated with lots of data. Should I even be thinking of rebuilding the data?\n\nI really appreciate the advise given to me in my post a couple of weeks back, if not for that I wouldn't have explored access as a db and decided to learn SQL to continue this project.\n\nAnyway, these are issues I am pondering over and would sort of like your opinions on other issues or how I may handle these issues.

I want to find what the maximum and minimum distance/ difference between these two functions is. I&amp;#39;ve attached an example (not the real thing) of what my data points are like - they are two separate functions and I have hundreds of rows of data for each column.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried this:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/392vzb/finding_max_distance_between_thousands_of/\"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/392vzb/finding_max_distance_between_thousands_of/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;but it was different to what I required. I&amp;#39;m quite desperate, so any help would be beyond appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you so much!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/8dudgg4bwou41.png?width=1298&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=3c3b31a9dc35529ce0d32f056dfd40a1f6c59bd8\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/8dudgg4bwou41.png?width=1298&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=3c3b31a9dc35529ce0d32f056dfd40a1f6c59bd8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
