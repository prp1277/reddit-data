I just got a job as a dispensary manager and inventory manager (2 roles one job). \n\nMy excel skills are basic. I worked with pivot tables but never created from scratch. I only understand sum and very basic excel functions. I can fill in and obviously understand and track data but I’ve never built a spreadsheet from scratch. I worked with ERP and SAP systems too but again I only worked on the outside. I was trained how to insert data but never to troubleshoot and learn the barebones. ERP and SAP is so valuable and I’m hitting myself for not learning more when i was at that job! \n\nI would like to take the MOS Excel expert exam to add to my job experience and resume. My job experience is very transferable. I am earning my psych degree and can transfer into multiple fields especially with certification +experience under my belt. I’m most interested in becoming an operations manager. \n\nAlso would adding a stats minor to my psych degree help? I already need two stats courses to graduate and I got a 93 in the first one. I don’t mind stats but I’m worried a minor will be a waste of time and money (going into 3rd year and my schedule is already stacked so I’d had enough to graduate later). \n\n2 questions:\n\n1. How long did it take to learn excel for you? \n\n2. How did it affect your career/salary ? (I’m currently at 50k but looking to be around 80k when I graduate in 2022 (is this a far fetched dream 😩🤣) Supply chain does pay well higher up and the cannabis field is growing in Canada by the minute. \n\n3. What did you use to study? (I’ve found a few YouTube sources via Reddit, going to download the study guide e book, and use google data sets to practice). \n\nAll suggestions and tips welcome!

Notice that there are technically no duplicates in the `code` column at all\n2. Even though there are no exact matches in the `code` column, the conditional format highlights the first three values.\n3. Notice also that the `count` column seems to match the behavior of the conditional format. The rows that show a count of **2** match the rows that are highlighted by the conditional format.\n4. However, (and this is the weird part), if you go to `Data | Remove Duplicates`, and select only the **code** column, Excel will report `\"No duplicate values found\"`.  **This contradicts the fact that the conditional format for duplicate values as well as the count formula indicate that the first three rows are duplicates.**\n\n\nDo any of you have any reasonable explanations for this, or is this just a quirk of Excel?\n\n\n[**Image here**](https://imgur.com/a/tOFCAZu)",

Within JIRA, you can report the \"time spent\" on a task, the \"estimated remaining time\", and the \"overall progress\" as a percentage (which is ultimately the value I want in Excel). \n\nUnfortunately, because nothing can be easy, when I go to export my Jira issue search content as a CSV for importing into Excel, **it can't/won't export the \"overall progress\" field**.  \n\nHowever, it does export the \"time spent\" and \"estimated remaining time.\"  But it exports them as text fields like in my title: \"2 weeks, 4 days\" or \"12 hours\" or \"6 days\" - like that.\n\nSo obviously i need to convert this to some sort of a number so that I can figure out how much progress has been made on a task.  Hence the question above.  I tried the DATEVALUE and TIMEVALUE but no joy.\n\n(Yes I am aware this is a ridiculous workaround and the real solution would be to get Jira to export that goddamn field.

My excel knowledge is competent but limited so any help would be greatly appreciated, happy to offer further clarification if needed.",

My excel knowledge is competent but limited so any help would be greatly appreciated, happy to offer further clarification if needed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Please do ask if I need to explain something better, tbh it's hurting my head but thankfully this is a one time job in the sense that once I find a way to automate this process of transferring my data from the rows of .xlsx into the appropriate sections &amp; formatted to folllow the template and purpose of the .csv file, I'll be well on my way.\n\nI also didn't see it against the rules of anything to offer a donation for helping me, I definately don't mind contributing to you through paypal or such, not for helping me, but out of pure generosity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you so much again.",

On page one, I want a simple table with the players names, and where they placed over 3 rounds (1-8). I then want it to look at a chart where 1 = 10 and 8 = 0, and at the bottom of each player's column, I want it to total the Points (Which is 10 points for 1st place, etc.) and just show score. Any ideas how to make this work?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hs44605f4ux41.png?width=719&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7453b8ed06e8079c7cd7c022ab7fcd340a72f92a\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ixfpw15f4ux41.png?width=932&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e7e74d7aa2407f7fbe999519f9a3a4811194ab7",

Exception from HRESULT: 0x800A03EC. it says that there are more details which I will link below - the full details are really long and I don&amp;#39;t really understand everything here, but I&amp;#39;ve linked it anyways.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://codeshare.io/24oVj7\"&gt;https://codeshare.io/24oVj7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s peculiar is that I do not get an error when no macro is recording (the table will load to the right place with no issues), however, when I record a macro and finally load the table, I get hit with the error message that&amp;#39;s inserted below and no table. Furthermore, the situation becomes even more strange because I have tried loading the table without all the transformations/changes in power query and it sometimes loads (but since I remove some of these changes, it&amp;#39;s not the table output that I want - unfortunately this never works when I apply all changes). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I pull in the data from &lt;a href=\"https://finnhub.io/api/v1/stock/candle?symbol=AAPL&amp;amp;resolution=1&amp;amp;from=1572651390&amp;amp;to=1572910590&amp;amp;token=bqp253nrh5rced4gh1n0\"&gt;https://finnhub.io/api/v1/stock/candle?symbol=AAPL&amp;amp;resolution=1&amp;amp;from=1572651390&amp;amp;to=1572910590&amp;amp;token=bqp253nrh5rced4gh1n0&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The edits I make through powerquery are linked here - this can be put in the advanced editor. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://codeshare.io/ax4gzd\"&gt;https://codeshare.io/ax4gzd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ijo1j4jh4vx41.png?width=657&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=031ad0736e24752a68ee1da595d709c93902200f\"&gt;This is the desired output&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/hys2b4jh4vx41.png?width=691&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=130bc001be5f274b05804636b7c4b65931d1b8b7\"&gt;This is the error message that I get&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If any of this is unclear, I can clarify in the comments!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
